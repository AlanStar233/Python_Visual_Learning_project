# v3 - Django REST Framework ViewSets

By using Django REST Framework ViewSets, you can consolidate the examples from the api.v2 even further, reducing the code to a single ViewSet. Our urls also take advantage of Django REST Framework ViewSet handling and we only have a single route to handle all requests to our endpoint. All verbs are handled properly and the browsable API is again, accessible if the endpoint is hit via a browser.
