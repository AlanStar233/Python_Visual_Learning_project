# v1 - Old School Django Generic Class-based View based API

This is one of the popular methods of creating an API that simply uses Django Genseric Views and specifies JSON as the response type.

From this example, you can see that for the most part, these views mimic the views used in the non-api part of the codebase for form submission, which means you as the developer are maintaining two sets of almost identical code to have a browser-based path, and API path, for your project.
