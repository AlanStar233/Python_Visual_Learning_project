# Do you know how to implement for Real-Time Face Recognition with a simple code?

Here Eazy Ciphers came with an eazy code for begineers in OpenCV which helps to recognize real-time face.

The Real-Time Face recognition completely deals with the python code implementation 

This model of training gives an accuracy of 99%. For training the input, we have to keep some sort of images in a folder where the user needs to train the model with the code.

Before entering into the description of running and training our model. One user must have to make sure that in their Environment OpenCV installed or not. 
If not installed install using below command:
```python
pip install opencv-python
```
### Installing Face Recognition module in windows: 

For face recognition module installation follow the below pip command to get through the recognition platform with an ease.

```python
pip install face_recognition
```

You can also try to install in any python platform which supports face_recognition module. 

The present problem statement is to implement and detect the real-time face with normal python environment in windows10. 

Normally detection of user defined images is bit time taken and worthy to detect and train that particular image. 
Well we take this eaziness into consideration and excetuing this python code.

Which helps to recognize face of the person and training of the code must done through giving a sample training image to the code, so that it performs the task of implementation the face recognition.

## Outputs:

The python libraries helps to identify for any sort of face recognition models:

Through the approach of ```face_recognition``` it makes simple to recognize face of one particular individual that we trained with the code.

## Similar way of Implementation can be done to recorded videos
